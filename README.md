# WDI- Project 4 : Frazier Controls
## About Frazier Controls
Frazier Controls's is a company that builds control systems for aquariums. The owner sets up exhibits at the Georgia Aquarium. The owner made a database for his company to keep track of projects exhibits and all the items that the exhibit needs. I created a GUI for his database so he doesn't have to use Excel anymore. This is a work in progress!
